### Analysis:
• White's early attack (moves 11-17) was promising but lacked follow-through after winning material
• Black's counterplay with Qxf2 (move 19) created decisive tactical opportunities despite material deficit
• White's repetitive knight checks (moves 54-63) showed desperation instead of finding winning moves
